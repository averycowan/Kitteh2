# Kitteh2
Second revision of my Kitteh language. Now comes with a compiler to x86.

[Example programs](test/tests/) (used to test the compiler)

# Build
Kitteh2 is written in Java 8 and uses ant as a build system. The repo itself is also set up as a NetBeans project.
Building the compiler: 

```
ant jar
```

Compiling a program:

```
java -jar dist/Kitteh2.jar -i test/tests/fizzbuzz.k -o output.s
gcc -o executable output.s
./executable
```

The first and second steps can optionally be combined:

```
java -jar dist/Kitteh2.jar -i test/tests/mandelbrot.k -o executable -e
./executable
```

# Options
`-v` enable verbose mode. compiler will print a lot more information and outputted assembly will include helpful comments

`-i inputFile.k` set the input location

`-o output` set the output location

`-I` read input program from standard in

`-O` write output to standard out. not recommended except for debugging

`-d` enable deterministic builds. when this option is enabled, the compiler will produce consistent output when ran repeatedly on the same input

`-e` generate an executable file instead of the assembly as a string. this options simply runs gcc under the hood

`-obf` obfuscate labels and function names in output. compatible with `-d`
